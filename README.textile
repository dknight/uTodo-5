h1. &micro;Todo 5

h2. Demonstrates HTML5 local storage engine and offline application.

This application uses valid HTML5 markup. Instead of cookies I try to use here local storage engine. For input I tried new attributes like "autofocus" and "required" for built-in validation.

This application can be available offline through cache.manifest file.
